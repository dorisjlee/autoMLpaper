\section{Study Analysis}
We analyze our study data agnostic of specific auto-ml tools but we aggregated our findings accounting for the categorical differences among the tools in our analysis of usage behaviors and perceptions, for example, open source vs. commercial tools.

We engaged in an iterative and collaborative process of inductive coding to extract common themes that repeatedly came up in our data. After completing the interviews, we met weekly and discussed themes and concepts as we continued our fieldwork. We used Dedoose, an online tool for open coding, to map data onto these categories. Each of first three authors independently coded the entire data. We conducted a categorization exercise in which we physically laid out themes and relevant quotes into emerging categories. Some of our initial categories included [TODO]. Through the open coding phase, the category of [TODO...] was the most pervasive, occurring in all of our transcripts.
