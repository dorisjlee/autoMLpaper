abstract="The success of machine learning in a broad range of applications has led to an ever-growing demand for machine learning systems that can be used off the shelf by non-experts. To be effective in practice, such systems need to automatically choose a good algorithm and feature preprocessing steps for a new dataset at hand, and also set their respective hyperparameters. Recent work has started to tackle this automated machine learning (AutoML) problem with the help of efficient Bayesian optimization methods. Building on this, we introduce a robust new AutoML system based on the Python machine learning package scikit-learn (using 15 classifiers, 14 feature preprocessing methods, and 4 data preprocessing methods, giving rise to a structured hypothesis space with 110 hyperparameters). This system, which we dub Auto-sklearn, improves on existing AutoML methods by automatically taking into account past performance on similar datasets, and by constructing ensembles from the models evaluated during the optimization. Our system won six out of ten phases of the first ChaLearn AutoML challenge, and our comprehensive analysis on over 100 diverse datasets shows that it substantially outperforms the previous state of the art in AutoML. We also demonstrate the performance gains due to each of our contributions and derive insights into the effectiveness of the individual components of Auto-sklearn.",

abstract="As data science becomes increasingly mainstream, there will be an ever-growing demand for data science tools that are more accessible, flexible, and scalable. In response to this demand, automated machine learning (AutoML) researchers have begun building systems that automate the process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines. In this chapter we present TPOT v0.3, an open source genetic programming-based AutoML system that optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification task. We benchmark TPOT on a series of 150 supervised classification tasks and find that it significantly outperforms a basic machine learning analysis in 21 of them, while experiencing minimal degradation in accuracy on 4 of the benchmarks---all without any domain knowledge nor human input. As such, genetic programming-based AutoML systems show considerable promise in the AutoML domain.",
